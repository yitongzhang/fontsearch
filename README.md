# fontsearch
## What
**Search google fonts by their features & anatomy.**
Fontsearch lets you filter google fonts by x-height, stroke contrast, serif size, stress axe and more.

## Why
**Because designing from first principles is important**
Searching fonts by their name sucks. How many body fonts can you name off the top of your head? Instead, enter the features that give a font good legibility (e.g. large x-height, low stroke contrast and asymmetric serifs) and see an exhaustive list of fonts that match your criteria.
